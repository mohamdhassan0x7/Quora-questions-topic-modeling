# Quora Questions Topic Modeling with TF-IDF and NMF

This project explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to uncover latent topics within Quora questions. It leverages two powerful algorithms:

* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** This method quantifies the importance of a word within a document relative to the entire collection, providing insights into vocabulary usage and topical emphasis.

* **NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization):** This dimensionality reduction technique decomposes a document-term matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices, revealing underlying thematic structures within the data.

**Project Goals:**

* **Topic Discovery:** The model aims to identify distinct themes and discussion areas present within the Quora questions dataset.
* **User Interest Analysis:** By understanding topic clusters, we can gain valuable insights into user interests and ongoing trends on the platform.
* **Improved Search and Recommendation:** Topic modeling can be used to group similar questions, enabling more efficient search results and personalized recommendations for users.

**Implementation Details:**

* The chosen dataset (e.g., CSV file containing Quora questions) undergoes basic preprocessing for optimal analysis.
* TF-IDF is applied to quantify the importance of terms within each question.
* NMF is then employed to decompose the document-term matrix, revealing the latent topic structure.
* The top words associated with each extracted topic are presented as the model output.

**Benefits:**

* **Understanding User Behavior:** Topic modeling helps us grasp the types of questions users are asking, revealing valuable market insights.
* **Improved Content Organization:** Categorizing questions by topic can facilitate better organization and navigation of content.
* **Enhanced User Experience:** By surfacing relevant topics and similar questions, topic modeling can contribute to a more user-friendly experience.

**Future Enhancements:**

* **Advanced Preprocessing:** Implementing techniques like stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal can further refine the model's accuracy.
* **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:** Exploring methods like PCA or LDA for dimensionality reduction alongside NMF could offer additional insights.
* **Evaluation:** Measuring the model's performance using metrics like coherence or perplexity can guide further optimization.

This project demonstrates the utility of TF-IDF and NMF for uncovering topic structure in textual data. By delving deeper into user behavior on Quora, we can improve user experience, content organization, and platform effectiveness.
